# how to compile

- It is simple. Just type this command
```
'make'
```
	- When you type "make" you get compile result named "main"
	- Before you run "main" file,  you need files named "input.dat" and "resource.dat"
	- After running "main", you get output file named "output.dat" 

- If you want to remove compile byproduct and product, you just type
```
% make clean
```
