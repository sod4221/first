# how to compile

- It is simple.just type 'make'
	- when you type 'make' you get compile result named 'main'
	- before you run 'main' you need 'input.dat' and 'resource.dat' file

- If you want to remove compile byproduct and product, you just type
```
% make clean
```
- This project is made in Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS
